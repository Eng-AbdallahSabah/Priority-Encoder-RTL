# Priority-Encoder-RTL

This repository offers a **Verilog RTL implementation** of an **8-to-3 Priority Encoder** along with a complete **testbench** and simulation setup for functional verification.

---

##  Design Overview
A **Priority Encoder** is a combinational circuit that encodes the index of the highest-priority active input (if multiple inputs are asserted) into a binary output. Here, the input with the highest index (e.g., bit 7 over bit 0) takes precedence. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Typical applications include **interrupt controllers**, **signal arbitration**, and conversion from high-resolution to binary indices. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

##  Getting Started

1. Open your simulator (e.g., **ModelSim** or **QuestaSim**).
2. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder:
   ```tcl
   cd scripts
   do run.do
3.Review the simulation output:
In results/transcript—for logs and behavioral data.
In results/Screenshot.png—for visual waveforms or signals.
In scripts/coverage_rpt.txt (if coverage was measured).

## 📊 Simulation Waveform

Below is a waveform captured using **QuestaSim**, showing the write and read operations on the RAM.  
The simulation confirms correct memory behavior across different clock cycles.

##  What’s Inside

RTL (priority_enc.v)
Implements the 8-to-3 encoder by prioritizing the highest active bit among multiple assertions.

Testbench (priority_enc_tb.sv)
Validates functionality across all scenarios, including edge cases and multiple inputs.

Simulation Setup

run.do: Automates compilation and execution scripts.

transcript: Logs simulation results.

coverage_rpt.txt: Functional coverage output (if coverage was enabled).

Visualization
A screenshot (waveform) illustrates signal transitions or output behavior.
