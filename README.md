# Priority-Encoder-RTL
This repository contains the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) implementation of an 8-to-3 Priority Encoder using Verilog. The design is suitable for integration into larger digital systems targeting FPGA or ASIC platforms. The project includes a testbench to verify the functional correctness of the design.
